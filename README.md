## Supported Language Versions

This SDK is compatible with the following versions: `TypeScript >= 4.8.4`

## Installation

To get started with the SDK, we recommend installing using `npm`:

```

# Authentication

## Access Token Authentication

The TestSdk API uses an Access Token for authentication.

This token must be provided to authenticate your requests to the API.

### Setting the Access Token

When you initialize the SDK, you can set the access token as follows:

```ts
const sdk = new TestSdk({ token: 'YOUR_TOKEN' });
```

If you need to set or update the access token after initializing the SDK, you can use:

```ts
const sdk = new TestSdk();
sdk.token = 'YOUR_TOKEN';
```
